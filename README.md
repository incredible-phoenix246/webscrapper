# Web Scraping Script README

## Introduction
This is a Python script for web scraping using the BeautifulSoup and requests libraries. It allows you to extract specific data from web pages by providing a URL.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- The following Python libraries installed:
  - BeautifulSoup (`beautifulsoup4`)
  - Requests (`requests`)

You can install these libraries using pip:

    pip install requests
    pip install beautifulsoup4 requests


Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine:

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/web-scraper.git


Navigate to the project directory:

    cd web-scraper

Run the script by executing the following command and providing the URL you want to scrape when prompted:

    python scraper.py
Follow the prompts to enter the URL you want to scrape.

The script will retrieve the HTML content of the webpage and extract specific data, such as links, text, or other elements, depending on your customization.

The extracted data will be displayed in the console.

Customization
You can customize the web scraping script to extract different types of data or target specific elements in the HTML. To do this, modify the scraper.py file and adjust the BeautifulSoup selectors according to your requirements.

Examples
Here are some common examples of how to use the web scraping script:

Extract all links from a webpage.
Retrieve text content from specific HTML elements (e.g., paragraphs, headings).
Collect data from tables or lists on a page.
Feel free to explore and adapt the script to suit your specific web scraping needs.
